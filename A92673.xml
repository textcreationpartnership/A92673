            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>Forasmuch as there have lately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in Arms, and are now risen in manifest Rebellion, in some Western Shires, great numbers of persons, who have had the boldness to fight and oppose Our standing Forces: For pursuing and dissipating of which rebells, We, with advice of Our Privy Council, having issued forth several Orders to the Earl of <hi>Linlithgow,</hi> Major-General, and Commander in Chief of Our Forces, and to the Militia Forces, Horse and Foot, in divers Shires, to concur and joyn with Our Forces, as they shall be Ordered. And whereas by the second <hi>Act</hi> of the first <hi>Session</hi> of Our second <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and the first <hi>Act</hi> of the third <hi>Session</hi> of that same <hi>Parliament,</hi> We, and Our Estates, have, for the greater security of the publick Peace, settled a Militia in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Shires, appointed days of rendezvous, and determined the penalties of absent Officers and Souldiers, in time of Peace and War; and particularly the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reikers of Horse and Foot, are lyable in six Pounds Scots for the absence of ilk Horse-man, and two Pounds Scots for ilk Foot-man, each day of the rendezvous in time of Peace, and the double thereof in time of War; and the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Militia, to be lyable to, and forefeit the Fynes following, <hi>viz.</hi> A Major, and a Captain of Foot, and a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and Collonel of Horse fifty Pounds, and the other inferior Officers twenty four pounds, for ilk days absence, in time of War, and the half thereof in time of Peace. And albeit We doubt not, but that the whole Officers and Soldiers of Our Militia will, upon this occasion, when such a rebellious rabble do presume to appear in Arms, attack, kill and invade Our Forces, cheerfully witness their zeal for Our service and their own security, and come forth and joyn in opposition to these Rebels, as they shall receive Orders: Yet We have thought fit hereby, in pursuance of Our saids Laws and Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to intimate and make known to the whole Officers and Soldiers of the Militia, that if they, or any of them shall refuse to come out, and keep their several dayes of Rendezvous, and joyn and act with Our Forces, as they shall be required by Our Privy Council or Commander in Chief, That they shall not only be fined in the particular penalties above-exprest, without favour or defalcation; But if they shall be negligent in their duty herein, they shall be looked upon as disaffected persons, and favourers and complyers with Rebels, and pursued and punished accordingly. And We Ordain these presents to be printed, and published at the Mercat-Cross of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and other places needfull. </p>
